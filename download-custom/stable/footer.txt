patches.

    * Updated the RDF library to version 3.  Anyone caring about RDF
      was probably already using the development version for this
      reason.  Added fast parsers for ntriples, Turtle and TriG
      formats.

    * Introduction of quasi quotation for _smooth_ and _safe_ inclusion
      of external language snippets

    * Upgrade of PlDoc to accept the common markdown constructs.

    * Many enhancements to the development tools, HTTP libraries,
      clib package. etc.  Better support for Unix daemon processes
      (syslog, UID/GID management, etc.)

    * A start for locale handling (supporting format/3, notably
      writing locale specific large integers.

    * Lots of stability stuff: fixed crashes, portability patches,
      build system enhancements, etc.
