---++ About the 5.8.x release

The 5.8.x release consolidates the 5.7.x development stream, which makes
the virtual machine implementation much easier to maintain and extend.
This has been used to improve it at various places: proper compilation
of =/2, dedicated instructions for common arithmetic operations, a few
super-instructions for common list operations and dedicated indexing
code for common constructs.

---++ Upgrading code for 5.6.64 to 5.8.x

We are assembling tricks and tips for upgrading your Prolog source to
run on 5.8.0 [[here][</Upgrade-5.8.html>]].


---++ Highlights:

    * Performance improvement on larger programs is between 10 and 40%,
    depending on the programming style. Notably the constraint solvers
    profit significantly. Small programs sometimes show much bigger
    speedups.

    * Updated module system:
          * Compile : if sufficiently instantiated
          * Provide real support for :- meta_predicate/1. Most of
	  the library code has replaced :- module_transparent/1
	  with :- meta_predicate/1.
	  * System libraries are no longer sensitive for predicates,
	  operators and changes of the unknown-flag in the user module.

    * Various compatibility enhancements resulting from discussion in
    the _|Prolog Commons|_ project.

	* Above mentioned meta_predicate/1 handling.
	* Support Ciao's _anonymous_ modules.
	* Support the ISO proposal for extensions to the core.
	* Added atomic_list_concat/2 and several friends.
	* Make :- initialization/1 ISO compatible (runs _after_ loading
	the file completes).
