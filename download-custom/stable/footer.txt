---++ About the 6.6.x release

SWI-Prolog 6.6.0 is based on version 6.5.3 with some addional patches.
The 6.6.x release is the last stable release before SWI-Prolog version 7.
It provides changes that make it easier to write code for version 7
that also runs on version 6.

Version 6.6 introduces some changes, notably in command line processing:

  - Processing of =|#!|=, binding a file to an interpreter in Unix no
    longer tries to be smart about processing options to the
    interpreter.  The effect of this change depends on the Unix
    versions: some only pass the first option, others pack all options
    into one and yet others pass the options after breaking them.

  - The Prolog flag =argv= only provides arguments that have not
    been processed by Prolog.

  - The init file =|.plrc|= (=pl.ini= on Windows) is no longer searched
    for in the working directory for security reasons.
