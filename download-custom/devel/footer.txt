---++ 6.1.x planned enhancements

Below is a lost of things on the TODO list. Current active development
is mainly focussed on the RDF library and enhancement of concurrent
performance.

    * Kernel issues

      * Reduce locking around atom-handling to provide better
	performance for multi-threaded applications that create
	many atoms.
      * Reduce trail-stack usage. (*partly*).
      * Reduce local-stack usage for multiple disjunctions in clauses.
      * Provide generational garbage collection.
      * Extend indexing with combined arguments and indexing inside
        compound terms.
      * Tabling
      * Further cleanup of the VM instruction API to simplify maintenance
	and future enhancements
      * Handle malloc() failures with exceptions rather then a
	fatal-error.

    * Libraries

      * RDF enhancements: better write-concurrency, get more out of
	named graphs and handle owl:sameAs mappings efficiently.
      * Move many goodies from
	[[ClioPatria][http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/software/ClioPatria.shtml]]
	to the HTTP and semweb libraries.

    * Community and development issues

      * Come to a better model for dealing with contributed code.  This
        model should allow for more independent and distributed
	development and make it easy for users to download and install
	packages.

---++ License issues of the binaries

The SWI-Prolog sources are covered by version 2 or later of the GNU
licenses ([[details][</license.html>]]).  The binaries are currently
linked against recent versions of the GMP bignum library, which is
licensed under LGPL version 3.  This implies that the distributed
SWI-Prolog binaries are covered by version 3 of these licenses.

It is possible to build SWI-Prolog with older versions of GMP (e.g.,
version 3) or without GMP.
