---++ 5.11.x planned enhancements

SWI-Prolog 5.10.0 was released a bit early, in the sense that two
enhancements in memory management are not or only partly realised.
These are moved to the 5.11.0 agenda:

    * Reduce trail-stack usage. (*partly*)
    * Provide generational garbage collection.

Otherwise, priorities have not yet settled. Just to show this doesn't
mean there are no plans, some points in random order.  Feel free to
suggest more or -better- help :-)

    * Kernel issues

      * Better indexing, including support for tries
      * Tabling
      * Further cleanup of the VM instruction API to simplify maintenance
	and future enhancements
      * Rewrite more/all term-traversing functions to avoid the use of
	C-based recursion.  This allows processing more deeply nested
	terms and proper resource-exceptions if there is insufficient
	memory
      * Handle malloc() failures with exceptions rather then a
	fatal-error.

    * Libraries

      * RDF enhancements: better write-concurrency, get more out of
	named graphs and handle owl:sameAs mappings efficiently.
      * Move many goodies from
	[[ClioPatria][http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/software/ClioPatria.shtml]]
	to the HTTP and semweb libraries.

    * Community and development issues

      * Come to a better model for dealing with contributed code.  This
        model should allow for more independent and distributed
	development and make it easy for users to download and install
	packages.
