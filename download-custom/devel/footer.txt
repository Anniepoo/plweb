---++ News

6.3.5 bumbed the semweb (RDF) library to version 3.  In a nutshell

  - Truly concurrent read/write
  - Prolog logical update view on the RDF database
  - Transactions changes
	- Transactions can be executed concurrently
	- Full atomicy and isolation support
	- Writes inside a transaction are visible following the
	  Prolog logical update view
  - Lock-free reading provides much better multicore scalability.

---++ 6.3.x planned enhancements

Below is a list of things on the TODO list.

    * Kernel issues

      * Reduce trail-stack usage. (*partly*).
      * Reduce local-stack usage for multiple disjunctions in clauses.
      * Provide generational garbage collection.
      * Extend indexing with combined arguments and indexing inside
        compound terms.
      * Tabling
      * Further cleanup of the VM instruction API to simplify maintenance
	and future enhancements
      * Handle malloc() failures with exceptions rather then a
	fatal-error.

    * Libraries

      * Move many goodies from
	[[ClioPatria][http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/software/ClioPatria.shtml]]
	to the HTTP and semweb libraries.

    * Community and development issues

      * Further enhance the `pack' system and try to get it popular.
