Documentation

Status nodes

    * Fully functional, but do not trust it too much
    * Performance improvement on larger programs is between 10 and 40%,
    depending on the programming style. Notably the constraint solvers
    profit significantly. Small programs sometimes show much bigger
    speedups.

    * Since 5.7.4, updated module system:
          * Compile : if sufficiently instantiated
          * Provide real support for :- meta_predicate. Most of
	  the library code has replaced :- module_transparent
	  with :- meta_predicate. 

    * Lots of cleanup in naming and modularization of the codebase.
