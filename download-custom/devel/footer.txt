---++ Windows

    * With thanks to `Degski', building the Windows version has
    become a lot simpler.  The above Windows binaries are created
    using his configuration framework with Microsoft VC9.  Uptill
    now, the Win32 binary was compiled with VC6 and the Win64
    version with VC8.

    The version above is for testing the release.

---++ 5.9.x planned enhancements

    * Replace sparse-address-space based stack allocation by
    stack-relocation (stack-shifting).  This seriously reduces
    address-space requirements, which is of great importance to
    applications using many _threads_. (*done*)

    * Remove =max_threads= limitation. (*done*)

    * Reduce trail-stack usage. (*partly*)

    * Provide generational garbage collection.
