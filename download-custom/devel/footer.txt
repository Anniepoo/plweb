---++ SWI-Prolog Version 7

SWI-Prolog version 7 is a major release that introduces significant
new concepts to the language.  A full description is in the
section [SWI-Prolog extensions](</pldoc/man?section=extensions>). Below is
a short summary.

  - Lists are no longer represented as .(H,T).  Instead, the list
    functor is now '$cons'(H, T).  The empty list is still [], but
    this is not an atom.  I.e., '[]' == [] fails.

  - By default, double quoted "text" is mapped to an object of type
    string.  This already raised some discussions.

  - The system introduces `dicts' as primary citizens.  Dicts are
    collections of key-value pairs, optionally tagged. Dicts are
    supported by read and write.  The syntax is

        ==
        tag{key1:value1, key2:value2, ...}
	==

    Keys in a dict can be addressed using the functional notation
    Dict.Key.  User functions on dicts can be accessed as Dict.Compound
    (e.g., Vector.multiply(V2)).

  - Putting quotes around operator names that do not need quoting
    stops the atom to act as an operator:

       ==
       ?- A = 'dynamic'/1.
       A = (dynamic)/1.
       ?- op(100, xf, 'Kwh').
       true.
       ?- A = 100'Kwh'.
       A = 100 'Kwh'.
       ==

  - Unquoted atoms may contain internal dots.  E.g., =a.b= is an
    atom.

  - functor() is valid syntax.  It produces a term that is distinct
    from 'functor'.  The `block' operator '()' to hack this syntax
    has been deleted.

  - The `block' operators [] and {} remain.
