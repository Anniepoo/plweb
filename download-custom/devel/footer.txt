---++ 6.3.x planned enhancements

Below is a list of things on the TODO list.

    * Kernel issues

      * Use larger allocation chunks for findall/3 to reduce contention.
      * Reduce trail-stack usage. (*partly*).
      * Reduce local-stack usage for multiple disjunctions in clauses.
      * Provide generational garbage collection.
      * Extend indexing with combined arguments and indexing inside
        compound terms.
      * Tabling
      * Further cleanup of the VM instruction API to simplify maintenance
	and future enhancements
      * Handle malloc() failures with exceptions rather then a
	fatal-error.

    * Libraries

      * RDF enhancements: Enhance handling of literals using the _|value
	space|_.  Figure out Boehm-GC based installations to support
	RDF store 3.0.
      * Move many goodies from
	[[ClioPatria][http://e-culture.multimedian.nl/software/ClioPatria.shtml]]
	to the HTTP and semweb libraries.

    * Community and development issues

      * Further enhance the `pack' system and try to get it popular.
