---++ Planned enhancements

    * Replace sparse-address-space based stack allocation by
    stack-relocation (stack-shifting).  This seriously reduces
    address-space requirements, which is of great importance to
    applications using many _threads_.

    * Remove =max_threads= limitation.

    * Reduce trail-stack usage.

    * Provide generational garbage collection.


---++ Status notes

    * The new stack-shifter is available on the branch =shift=.  Its
    implementation is complete, but the code is still rather unstable.
    As soon as this is stable, the =shift= branch will be merged into
    the =master=.
