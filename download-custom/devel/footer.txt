---++ About this release

The 5.7.x branch significantly makes the virtual machine implementation
much easier to maintain and extend. This has been used to improve it at
various places: proper compilation of =/2, dedicated instructions for
common arithmetic operations, a few super-instructions for common list
operations and dedicated indexing code for common constructs.

The 5.7.x branch has its own GIT repository at the address below. See
the general [[GIT][</git.html>]] instructions for details.

---++ Status notes

SWI-Prolog 5.7.15 is the first release candidate for 5.8.0.  It is
currently the *|recommended version|*, especially for people using the
(semantic) web or the constraint libraries.  Highlights:

    * Performance improvement on larger programs is between 10 and 40%,
    depending on the programming style. Notably the constraint solvers
    profit significantly. Small programs sometimes show much bigger
    speedups.

    * Updated module system:
          * Compile : if sufficiently instantiated
          * Provide real support for :- meta_predicate/1. Most of
	  the library code has replaced :- module_transparent/1
	  with :- meta_predicate/1.
	  * System libraries are no longer sensitive for predicates,
	  operators and changes of the unknown-flag in the user module.

    * Various compatibility enhancements resulting from discussion in
    the _|Prolog Commons|_ project.

	* Above mentioned meta_predicate/1 handling.
	* Support Ciao's _anonymous_ modules.
	* Support the ISO proposal for extensions to the core.
	* Added atomic_list_concat/2 and several friends.
	* Make :- initialization/1 ISO compatible (runs _after_ loading
	the file completes).
