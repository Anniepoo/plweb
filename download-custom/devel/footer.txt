---++ Status notes

SWI-Prolog 5.7.x is now being tested on several big applications.  It
is the *|recommended version for development|*.  Please test carefully
before you use it in mission-critical applications and report bugs.


    * Performance improvement on larger programs is between 10 and 40%,
    depending on the programming style. Notably the constraint solvers
    profit significantly. Small programs sometimes show much bigger
    speedups.

    * Since 5.7.4, updated module system:
          * Compile : if sufficiently instantiated
          * Provide real support for :- meta_predicate. Most of
	  the library code has replaced :- module_transparent
	  with :- meta_predicate. 

    * Lots of cleanup in naming and modularization of the codebase.
