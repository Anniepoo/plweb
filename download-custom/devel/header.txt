Linux versions are often available as a package for your distribution.
We collect information about available packages and issues for building
on specific distros [[here][</build/LinuxDistro.txt>]].
We provide a [[PPA][https://launchpad.net/~swi-prolog/+archive/devel]]
for [[Ubuntu][http://www.ubuntu.com/]]

[[windows.jpg;align="left",width="24px"][</build/windows.txt>]] Starting
with version 6.1.7, the Windows binary is compiled using the
[[MinGW][http://www.mingw.org]] GCC based compiler suite. Due to changed
naming conventions this implies that extension DLLs are neither forward
nor backward compatible. Please check the [[windows release
nodes][</windows.html>]] (also in the SWI-Prolog startup menu of your
installed version).
