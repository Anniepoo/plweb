---+ Download SWI-Prolog development versions

[[linux.png;align="left"][</build/LinuxDistro.txt>]] Linux versions are
often available as a package for your distribution. We collect
information about available packages and issues for building on specific
distros [[here][</build/LinuxDistro.txt>]].

[[windows.jpg;align="left"][</build/windows.txt>]] Starting with version
6.1.7, the Windows binary is compiled using the
[[MinGW][http://www.mingw.org]] GCC based compiler suite. Due to changed
naming conventions this implies that extension DLLs are neither forward
nor backward compatible. Please check the [[windows release
nodes][</windows.html>]] (also in the SWI-Prolog startup menu of your
installed version).
