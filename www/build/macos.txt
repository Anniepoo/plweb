---+ Building SWI-Prolog on MacOS (Leopard and Snow Leopard)

This note was sent to the SWI-Prolog mailinglist on Jan 10, 2010
by Paulo Moura.

    1. The fix for the XPCE configure script bug, that results in the
    settings in the SWI-Prolog portfiles to be ignored needs to be
    back-ported from 5.9.4 to 5.8.x. Apparently, this bug results in X11
    libraries being searched in /usr/lib, which works on Linux but not
    on MacOS X. On Leopard, the X11 are either installed in
    /opt/local/lib by the "xorg-libs" port or in /usr/X11/lib by the
    XQuartz installer. Snow Leopard already includes compatible X11
    libraries in /usr/X11.

    2. Make sure that the Developer Tools are installed. The Xcode
    installer is included in the install DVDs. The latest version of
    Xcode can be downloaded from Apple after a free registration (if
    memory serves).

    3. Make sure that both X11 *and* the X11 SDK are installed. These
    are optional installs on Snow Leopard. Use your install DVDs if
    needed (You get the X11 SDK through the Xcode installer, if memory
    serves). When installing SWI-Prolog >= 5.9.4 from sources using the
    portfiles I posted to this list, the "xorg-libs" port (a dependency
    declared in the "swi-prolog-devel" portfile) install the X11 libs in
    /opt/local/lib.

    4. Don't use the MacOS X 10.5 installers on 10.6. It will most
    likely don't work and will lead to further problems if later you try
    to install from sources (e.g. "wrong architecture" errors when
    trying to run SWI-Prolog).

    5. Make sure that you're running an up-to-date installation of
    MacPorts. In doubt, and if you are not using MacPorts for anything
    else, simply delete the /opt/local directory.

    6. On Snow Leopard do not try the XQuartz installer. It's not needed
    and it will not work.

    7. Don't use the SWI-Prolog portfiles downloaded using MacPorts
    until the following commands:

	==
        port info swi-prolog
        port info swi-prolog-lite
        port info swi-prolog-devel
	==

    show versions >= 5.9.4 for the development release and >= 5.8.3 for
    the stable release. Usually, I submitted update portfiles as soon as
    new release of SWI-Prolog are out. Unfortunately, it may take some
    time for the portfiles to be committed and made available when
    self-updating the MacPorts installation.

    8. Use the portfile attached below with the procedure described in
    the MacPorts guide for custom, local portfiles and also described in
    a message to this list by Henry Soldano in December 22 to get
    SWI-Prolog 5.9.6 up and running on Snow Leopard.

Most likely there are still some non-diagnosed issues when installing
SWI-Prolog on Snow Leopard. For once, I successfully installed 5.8.0 and
5.8.2 using stock MacPorts on a brand new laptop without the issues
reported by Norbert's. But I also use a lot of other ports, which may
play some part on this never-ending story.

In an ideal world, Jan and me would have access to both clean PowerPC
and Intel Macs, running 10.5 and 10.6, and enough free time to diagnose
these issues and provide both bullet-proof source installation
instructions and binary installers. For now, please report your
experiences, both successful and unsuccessful ones, with as much details
as possible. I hope to be able to work on binary installers by February.
