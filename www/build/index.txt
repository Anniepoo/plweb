---+ Build SWI-Prolog from source

The sources are common for all platforms, but the way to build them is
totally different for MS-Windows and all Unix/POSIX based platforms.
Unless you plan to use SWI-Prolog for seriously for a longer period of
time, we strongly *discourage* building the *Windows* version
yourself. On the other hand, we generally *encourage* building
yourself on *|non-windows platforms|* because binaries tend to be less
portable and building is much easier.
