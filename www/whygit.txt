---+ Why did SWI-Prolog move to GIT?

The SWI-Prolog project moved from CVS to GIT because

    * CVS started to become too slow
    * CVS doesn't support staging very well. I like frequent commits to
    synchronise between machines, commit work that is known to be
    incomplete, etc. For GIT this is the natural model, for CVS it is
    just too cumbersome.
    * GIT allows for offline working.
    * GIT checkouts are totally stand alone, making local branches much
    easier as well as providing security against system failure, etc. 

Sofar, we are very happy with this move. Recent system failures have
indeed proved that the distributed approach allows to restoring the
central repository from the development systems easily.
