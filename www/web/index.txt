---+ SWI-Prolog for the (semantic) web

The (semantic) web is one of the most promising application areas for
SWI-Prolog. Prolog handles the semantic web RDF model naturally, where
RDF provides a stable model for knowledge representation with shared
semantics. It turns out that Prolog is also quite capable of providing
web-services (HTTP), especially where it comes to dynamic generation of
HTML pages and providing data for Javascript web-applications using the
[[JSON][<json:>]] serialisation.

---++ Standard packages

Below are the most vital packages for programming web services and RDF
processing.

    $ [[Web-server and client library][</pldoc/package/http.html>]] :
    Core web package. Provides an HTTP server and client, session
    handling, authorization, logging, etc.  Libraries for generating
    HTML pages and JSON.

    $ [[RDF storage and query library][</pldoc/package/semweb.html>]] :
    Load/save RDF and query it.  The library loads and saves XML/RDF
    and Turtle.  Its database scales to approx. 20M triples on 32-bit
    hardware and 300M triples on a 64-bit machine with 64-Gb memory.
    Also provides simple RDFS and OWL support.

    $ [[Spatial indexing library][</pldoc/package/space.html>]] :
    SWI-Prolog interface to Spatial Index and GEOS libraries, providing
    spatial indexing of URIs. Supports import and export to GML, KML,
    and RDF with GeoRSS Simple, GeoRSS GML, and W3C WGS84 vocabulary
    properties.

    [[alert.gif]] This package is provided in the source, but not
    (yet) in the binary distributions. The source contains
    instructions for building the dependencies and the indexer itself.


---++ Separately distributed packages

Some packages are distributed separately.


    $ [[The Triple20 ontology editor][Triple20.txt]] :
    Graphical tool for browsing and editing ontologies.  Not very well
    maintained, but useful for browsing loaded RDF and it has two nice
    features: it scales well and it can handle multiple ontologies and
    allows for editing them in a unified view.

    $ [[The ClioPatria semantic search web-server][<ClioPatria.html>]] :
    This library provides a ready-to-run web-server that includes
    a SPARQL endpoint, user-right management and RDF development tools.
    ClioPatria is an RDF-application development framework.

    $ [[Thea, an OWL library for SWI-Prolog][<thea:>]] :
    Provides access to OWL ontologies at the level of the abstract
    syntax. Can interact with external DL reasoner using
    [[DIG][<dig:>]].  The project is [[hosted on
    GitHUB][http://wiki.github.com/vangelisv/thea]].  See also
