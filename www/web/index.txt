---+ SWI-Prolog for the (semantic) web 

The (semantic) web is one of the most important application area for
SWI-Prolog. Prolog handles the semantic web RDF model naturally, where
RDF provides a stable model for knowledge representation with shared
semantics. It turns out that Prolog is also quite capable of providing
web-services (HTTP), especially where it comes to dynamic generation of
HTML pages and providing data for Javascript web-applications using the
[[JSON][<json:>]] serialisation.

---++ Standard packages

Below are the most vital packages for programming web services and RDF
processing.

    $ [[Web-server and client library][</pldoc/package/http.html>]] :
    Core web package. Provides an HTTP server and client, session
    handling, authorization, logging, etc.  Libraries for generating
    HTML pages and JSON.

    $ [[RDF storage and query library][</pldoc/package/semweb.html>]] :
    Load/save RDF and query it.  Also provides simple RDFS and OWL
    support.


---++ Seperately distributed packages

Some packages are distributed separately.  


    $ [[The Triple20 ontology editor][Triple20.txt]] :
    Graphical tool for browsing and editing ontologies.  Not very well
    maintained, but useful for browsing loaded RDF and it has two nice
    features: it scales well and it can handle multiple ontologies and
    allows for editing them in a unified view.

    $ [[The ClioPatria semantic search web-server][<cliopatria:>]] :
    This library resulted from the [[MultimediaN][<multimedian:>]]
    project.  It is used in various large projects and provides
    a [[SPARQL][<sparql:>]] and [[SeRQL][<serql:>]] endpoint. These
    end-points can also be use without the rest of ClioPatria.

    $ [[Thea, an OWL library for SWI-Prolog][<thea:>]] :
    Provides access to OWL ontologies at the level of the abstract
    syntax. Can interact with external DL reasonder using
    [[DIG][<dig:>]]
