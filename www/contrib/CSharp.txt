---+ SWI-Prolog interface to C#

This is a new version of the CSharp Interface.

This interface is published here to start discussions, getting comments
or suggestions for improvement. Please inform me about your experiences
and tell me your proposals for modification.

For a demonstration of a server application using backtracking in each
session have a look at

The first CSharpInterface (.net framework version 1.1) was more or less
a port of the C++ interface. This version is build to make
Prolog-queries easy and intuitive for .Net programers. The main changes
are:

    * PlTerm is a struct, not a class.
    * Callbacks from prolog to C# are possible.
    * Compiled with framework version 3.5.
    * A VS test project.
    * Adapt Microsoft coding guideline ( checked by FxCop ).
    * Enumerators for PlQuery and PlTerm ( Prolog lists )
    * A help file for documentation 

Here is an example:

==
PlQuery q = new PlQuery("member(A, [a,b,c])");
foreach (PlTermV s in q.Solutions)
    Console.WriteLine(s[0].ToString());
==

The documentation is also online available at
http://www.lesta.de/prolog/swiplcs/Generated/Index.aspx

At present I only publish the binarys including the documentation. The
sources will be published later. If you like to see them or work on them
don't hesitate to contact ma via mail.
