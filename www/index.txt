---+ SWI-Prolog's home

"Software-Patents" in Europe: The threat prevails European Parliament
said No to software patents with 648 votes against 14. Open Source and
smaller innovative compagnies have won a battle, but not yet the war.
Please be aware of the danger. More info at the [[FFII
website][<ffii:>]] as well as the [[FSF website][<fsf:>]].

---++ And now about SWI-Prolog ...

[[coolstar.gif;align="right",alt="Open directory cool site"][<dmoz_pl:>]]
SWI-Prolog offers a comprehensive [[Free Software][<fsf:>]] Prolog
environment, licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License. Together with
its graphics toolkit [[XPCE][<pkg:xpce/>]], its development started in
1987 and has been driven by the needs for *|real-world applications|*.
These days SWI-Prolog is widely used in research and education as well
as for commercial applications. See our download statistics.

---++ SWI-Prolog's most important features are

    * Kernel licensed under the [[LGPL][<lgpl:>]]. Prolog libraries are
    distributed under the [[GPL][<gpl:>]] with an additional statement
    that allows for use in proprietary applications. Details can be
    found on the license.txt page.

    * Very *fast* compilation.

    * *Robust*.

    * *Small*. The full development environment, including graphics,
    libraries and many interface packages requires approx. 28MB
    harddisk. The non-graphical kernel is about 1.1 MB, the graphics
    library adds about 1.2 MB to the image.

    * *Scales* well for large applications. No limits on program size,
    atom-length, functor-arity or integer values. No performance
    degradation on predicates with many (indexed) facts. Handles
    [[Wordnet][<wordnet:>]] with ease (loads in 1.1 sec on an AMD
    1600+). Each individual runtime stack is limited to 128 MB on 32-bit
    machines and virtually unlimited on 64-bit hardware.

    * *|Unbounded integer|* and *rational* number arithmetic
    based on [[GMP library][<gmp:>]].

    * Comprehensive set of built-in predicates, covering *|Part 1 of the
    ISO standard|*, the de-facto *Edinburgh* Prolog standard and
    important parts of Quintus and SICStus Prolog. Fair
    compatibility to Ciao, YAP and GNU-Prolog.

    * Flexible and fast interface to the *|C-|* and *|C++-Language|*.
    The interface allows for calling both-ways, handling of
    non-determinism both ways and *embedding* of the SWI-Prolog kernel
    in C/C++ projects.

    * The goodies: *modules* (upward compatible to Quintus and SICStus),
    *|garbage-collection|* (transparent to C/C++-code, including *atom*
    garbage collection), *|last-call|* optimisation, Dynamic expansion
    of the runtime stacks, *|ISO exception-handling|* (including C/C++
    interface for catching and throwing exceptions).

    * Execution profiler.txt (time and call statistics) for Linux, most
    Unix platforms and Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista.

    * April, 2006 Cross-Referencer. gxref/0 provides a graphical
    front-end for the extensible Prolog cross-referencer (xref).

    * Portable to many platforms, including almost all Unix/Linux
    platforms, Windows (NT/2000/XP/Vista, including 64-bit editions),
    MacOS X (using X11 for graphics) and many more. Both 32-bits and
    64-bits hardware is supported. Sources are plain C99, configured
    automatically using GNU autoconf (configure, make, make install).

    * December 22, 2005 UNICODE character set handling internal. Ideal
    for web- and international applications.

    * Machine-independent saved-states (save on one platform, run using
    the virtual machine of another platform).

    * Multi-threading support: run multiple pre-emptively scheduled
    prolog engines on the same database.

    * attributed variables, coroutining (freeze/2, when/2, dif/2),
    global variables, cyclic terms. Flag-controlled handling of
    occurs-check (on/off/error).

    * Constraint Logic Programming, providing libraries for CHR
    (Constraint Handling Rules), 2007clp(FD), clp(R,Q) and various
    others.

    * Bundled with interface libraries for Java (JPL), ODBC, TCP/IP
    sockets, SSL, CGI form handling, etc. Check the packages.

    * Multi-threaded Web server ( HTTP) library with extensive libraries
    for generation HTML, HTTP authorization, session management,
    exchanging JSON (used by many AJAX widgets), etc.

    * Fast and flexible libraries for parsing SGML (HTML) and XML, RDF,
    store and query the RDF triple model. A graphical editor for
    RDF/RDFS and OWL models called Triple20 is distributed seperately.

    * Literate programming support through PlDoc. Provides integrated
    view on manual and application documentation and producing LaTeX
    documentation for your application.

    * Unit testing support through PlUnit.

    * Regular binary distributions for most popular platforms (Windows
    (32/64 bits), Linux (32 bits) and MacOS X (32 bits)).

    * Regular distribution of the full source packages. The sources are
    also accesible through GIT.
