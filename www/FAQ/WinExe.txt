---+ Creating a Windows console application from SWI-Prolog

If you want to use a SWI-Prolog program as a stand-alone .exe for
example to use it as a CGI script, you can do this using qsave_program/2
or using the commandline. The command below creates myapp.exe from
load.pl and makes the program start at main/0

==
plcon -o myapp.exe -c load.pl --goal=main
==

To run, myapp.exe requires libpl.dll and any other dll it uses through
libraries to be in the same directory, in %PATH% or in the Windows
directory. See PceWinExe.txt for additional information about DLLs and
changing icons.
