---+ Site and personal initialisation files

On startup, SWI-Prolog reads both site initialisation and personal
initialisation files. Both can be controlled explicitely using
commandline options (*|-F base|* for site, and *|-f base|* for personal
initialisation).

The site-initialisation file is located in the SWI-Prolog home
directory. Its name is deduced from the commandname by taking the
leading alphanumerical characters, followed by the extension =|.rc|=.
Using default installation this implies *|pl.rc|* for the Unix version
and *|plwin.rc|* for the Windows version.

If XPCE is installed, it is activated through the above named system
default file.

The personal initialisation file is called *|.plrc|* on Unix and
*|pl.ini|* on Windows. It is searched using the file_search_path/2 alias
=user_profile=. This refers to the current working directory, the users
home (if any) or the Prolog home if the user has none (single-user OS).

In *|plwin.exe|*, the personal initialisation file is accessible through
the *|Settings menu|*. First use copies a default file with some
commented common constructs. The same behaviour is also available from
the graphical Prolog manual provided by XPCE and started with help/0.

The *|-s file|* commandline option is commonly used on Unix systems to
load and start applications using a single command.   In can also be
used to create PrologScript.txt files.
