---+ How do I enlarge the stacks?

Old versions of SWI-Prolog had quite limited default stack-sizes. As of
version 5.10.0, there are no resources involved with unused spack-space
and the limits on 32-bit platforms are by default the maximum that can
be handled on these platforms: 128Mb. On 64-bit platforms the default is
256Mb, which typically means you have the same limit as on 32-bit
systems. However, on 64-bit platforms you can extend the limits.

---++ But, my program is too big. What now?

Prune choicepoints. Deterministic programs use way less memory on all
the stacks. Use the SWI-Prolog [[source-level debugger][../gtrace.txt]]
to find choicepoints.

---++ But I really have a lot of choicepoints and data

SWI-Prolog can handle that on 64-bit systems. As of version 5.10.0, the
limits can be modified at runtime using set_prolog_stack/2. In addition,
the mechanisms beloe can be used.  Continue at the appropriate section.

---+++ Enlarging the stacks in Windows

In windows you have several options.

    * Using a .BAT file you can provide the appropiate options.
    * You can modify the shortcut from menu or desktop to include the options.
    * You can open *|Preferences/Stack|* sizes from the plwin.exe menu
    and specify new limits. These limits are stored in the Windows
    registry and are the default for any new Prolog instance you start.
    * You can use the PrologScript.txt magic sequence, which is handled
    for a Prolog file you open using double-click just as the Unix
    version does, except that the path to the executable is ignored (but
    some path must be specified).

---+++ Enlarge the stacks in Unix

    * Use a shell script
    * Use a PrologScript.txt
    * Use command-line options

---++++ Specifying stack-sizes using Prolog Script

Make sure your file starts with #!, followed by location of Prolog,
followed by options you want to pass and ending with the -s (script)
option. Here is an example using 4Gbytes global stack on a default
Linux installation:

==
#!/usr/bin/swipl -G4g -s
==

---++++ Stack related commandline options

Stack sizes are specified in Kbytes (*k*, default), Mbytes (using *m*
postfix) or Gbytes (using *g* postfix).

    $ -L<size>[kmg] :
      Specify local stack. Here go environments and choicepoints.
      Determinism and last-call optimization (tail-recursion) keep it
      small.

    $ -G<size>[kmg] :
      Global stack. Here are compound terms, lists, floats, large
      integers and strings. Efficient data-structures and determinism
      keep it small.

    $ -T<size>[kmg] :
      Trail stack. Here goes information for rewinding to a choicepoint.
      Again determinism is a dominant factor to keep it small.
