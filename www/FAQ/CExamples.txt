---+ Where do I find examples mixing C and Prolog?

You can download the source and check the sources of one or more of the
packages. There is a complicated example in the form of an TeX tokeniser
in the ltx2htm subdirectory of the sources. There are a couple of
examples in the src/win32/ subtree of the sources for handling Windows
API. Finally, there is the SWI-Prolog source-code itself that uses the
foreign interface for realising many of the build-in predicates. The
function is normally called pl_<predicate-name>. See pl-ext.c for the
function-names of all predicates. Note however that the system itself
sometimes uses more low-level constructs to manipulate Prolog data.
Never use functions that have no prototype in SWI-Prolog.h or
SWI-Stream.h.

@tbd	Update: there are much better packages to look into
