---+ Representation and printing of floating point numbers

SWI-Prolog internally represents floats using the C-language type
double. On most today systems this implies using a 64-bit IEEE
representation. All math functions are based on the C math-library.

The write/1 predicate and friends using the C-function printf() using
the format specified by the Prolog flag =float_format=, default =|%g|=.
So, to print floats using 10 decimals do

==
:- set_prolog_flag(float_format, '%.10f').
==

See the manual page for printf() for details on printf format
specifiers. The predicate format/3 prints floats using ~f which has an
optional precision specifier:

==
?- A is pi,
   format('Pi = ~15f~n', [A]).
Pi = 3.141592653589793

A = 3.14159.
==

If all this isn't enough, please check out SWI-Prolog's support for
rational numbers in the [[manual][</man/arith.html>]].
