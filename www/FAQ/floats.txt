---+ Representation and printing of floating point numbers

SWI-Prolog internally represents floats using the C-language type
double. On most today systems this implies using a 64-bit IEEE
representation. All floating point math functions are based on the C
math-library.

The write/1 predicate and friends use the =dtoa= library by _|David M.
Gay|_ that prints floating point numbers with the minimal number of
digits such that read/1 reads back the same value.  If you want floats
printed with a specific number of digits, use format/2:

==
?- A is pi, format('Pi = ~5f~n', [A]).
Pi = 3.14159
A = 3.141592653589793.
==

Floating point numbers are not exact. If you want exact arthmetic,
please check out SWI-Prolog's support for rational numbers in the
[[manual][</man/arith.html>]].
