---+ Creating executables on Unix/Linux

I have only find how to make this from in the swi-prolog, if any know
how to do all this on commandline eg. like windows/dos version please
add here.

In this example I have used an example program called vem.pl In the
example you also can see how to declare the main stuff.

The program is added at the end.

    1. First place you in the catalog with the prolog file.

    2. Start swi-prolog --> pl

       Load the program

       ==
       ?- consult(vem.pl)
       ==

       Make a runtime: vem = the name the excutable will get; main = the start

       ==
       ?- qsave_program(vem,[stand_alone(true),goal(main)]).
       ==

       now exit prolog

       ==
       ?- ctrl-d
       ==

       change the program to runable

       ==
       chmod +x vem
       ==

       run it

       ==
       ./vem
       ==

Problem!

If only you can run the program this is a rights problem, chmod +x only
add rights for current user, learn more about chmod from the systems
helpsystem man chmod

example program vem.pl

==
:-op(600,xfx,has).

anders has car.
kalle has buss.

main :-
   Vem has car.
==
