---+ SWI-Prolog Support

If you have problems with SWI-Prolog there are a number of places you
can go for help from the community:

    * The [[FAQ][</FAQ/>]].

    * The Mailinglist.txt and its archive or search the internet. Tip:
    include =SWIPL= to search the mailinglist archives.

    * If you encountered a bug.txt, please report it using the
    [[Bugzilla Bug Tracking System][<bugzilla:>]].

    * Debian Linux also has a [[bug tracking
    system][http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=swi-prolog]]
    for SWI-Prolog informing the Debian maintainer Michael Piefel.
    Please use this for packaging or other very Debian specific
    problems.

    * There are a lot of resources such as libraries, interfaces, ports
    and applications that are not mentioned on the SWI-Prolog website.
    Therefore, if the above doesn't help you may wish to check
    [[comp.lang.prolog][<news:comp.lang.prolog>]] or search the
    internet.

If you find things that can be of interest for other SWI-Prolog users,
please E-mail them to the Mailinglist.txt.
