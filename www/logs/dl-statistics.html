Above is a graphical representation of the download statistics for SWI-Prolog
from <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org">http://www.swi-prolog.org</a>.  Note
that SWI-Prolog also appears on many Linux distributions and is shipped with
various Prolog text-books.

Since March 2009, the website is served by Prolog itself.  Unlike before,
failed and cancelled downloads are now excluded from the counts.
