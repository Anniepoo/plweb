---+ The new SWI-Prolog web-site

Finally, SWI-Prolog hosts itself on the web.

---++ TODO

    * Provide last-modified support for wiki pages
    * Support bug-reporting
    * Downloads (less urgent now that we can use webalizer)
	* Support download statistics
	    * By version, platform/src
	    * By time period
    * Allow Wiki editing?
	* Local-host only (like PlDoc)?
	* Wiki-style
    * Process .txt links in @see (See PceEmacs in FAQ)

Update Apache (local note):

    * /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl -k graceful
