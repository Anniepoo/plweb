---+ The new SWI-Prolog web-site

The new web-site will be served by Prolog itself, exploiting the PlDoc
infrastructure.  Pages will be mostly PlDoc wiki pages.

---++ TODO

    * Embed generating wiki pages into a more general page layout that
    provides:

	* Styling (CSS)
	* The SWI-Prolog logo
	* The right menu.  The right menu can be defined as a wiki file
	and use divs.

    * Extend wiki includes

	* Support [[assert/1]] to include documentation from the
	system manual.
	* Allow naming links

    * Allow Wiki editing?
