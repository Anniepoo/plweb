---+ The new SWI-Prolog web-site

The new web-site will be served by Prolog itself, exploiting the PlDoc
infrastructure.  Pages will be mostly PlDoc wiki pages.

---++ TODO

    * Serve wiki pages as .html (allow for mirroring)
    * Allow [[pred/arity]] from predicates defined in the
    reference manual.
    * Provide last-modified support for wiki pages
    * Support FAQ
    * Support bug-reporting
    * Link to GIT browsing
    * Downloads
	* Allow reporting only last or all versions
	* Use thread-pool for scalability
	* Support download statistics
	    * By version, platform/src
	    * By time period
    * Allow Wiki editing?
	* Local-host only (like PlDoc)?
	* Wiki-style
